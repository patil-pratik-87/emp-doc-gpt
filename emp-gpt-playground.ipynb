      "1. **Go beyond bin-packing.** EMP optimizes your Kubernetes utilization by reclaiming existing unused capacity in your cluster. This enables you to go much further beyond just the bin packing benefits, and actually optimize capacity that is allocated to your pods via request and limit values but not actually utilized. \n",
      "2. **Optimize without right-sizing**: Many existing tools try to optimize your Kubernetes resource consumption by modifying your pod's request and limit values. But since EMP can actually tap into existing unused capacity to deploy new workloads, EMP requires making no changes to your pod's request and limit values. \n",
      "3. **Rebalance with zero pod downtime**: When EMP needs to scale and add more capacity, or consolidate to better use existing capacity, it can 'live migrate' workloads around to do this. This means zero pod disruption and much higher availability for your stateful workloads. This is specially important for data services, AI/ML or large java web applications. \n",
      "4. **Continuous Optimization**: EMP automatically monitor and optimize VM deployments behind the scenes to maximize Kubernetes resource utilization.\n",

CloudHealth, Cloudability, and Datadog are great tools for understanding your cloud costs and identifying areas where you can save money. However, they do not specifically focus on automating the changes needed to increase your overall resource utilization.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then there are tools such as open source Karpenter that make use of effective bin packing to allocate nodes just in time that fit your pod's resource requirements. However, these tools can not make a dent at optimizing your Kubernetes utilization if there is resource wastage due to high request and limit values. These tools will also involve a 'consolidation' phase where nodes are interrupted to consolidate fragmented pod deployments. This also requires pod restart which many stateful applications can not tolerate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then there are tools that make it easy to use spot instances with your EKS clusters to reduce your costs. However, spot instances are not a good fit for stateful applications that can not tolerate node interrupts, thus putting a ceiling on the amount of savings such tools can offer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly there are tools that makes adjustments to your application's request and limit values as a way to cut costs. But these tools will also require pod restart for the changes to take effect.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a result, despite the use of these tools, Kubernetes utilization remains low, ranging between 15 and 30%. That means 70% or more of your k8s cloud resources are being completely wasted.\n",
      "\n",
      "With EMP, there is no change to the request and limit values of your application necessary. Your developers will continue to set the requests and limits on the application pods that they desire, and EMP will work behind the scenes to optimize your EKS resource utilization based on demand.\n",

      "Application developers frequently define the resource requirements of their Kubernetes workloads based on peak CPU and memory requirements. However, real-world usage may frequently vary or be significantly lower than configured values for the majority of the time, necessitating ongoing adjustments to pod request and limit values by DevOps teams or Developers. EMP addresses this by deploying an alternate virtualization layer that monitors actual resource usage of your applications and dynamically allocates compute resources to meet the needs of your application, eliminating the need for manual configuration changes to your pod request and limit values.\n",

      "Application developers frequently define the resource requirements of their Kubernetes workloads based on peak CPU and memory requirements. However, real-world usage may frequently vary or be significantly lower than configured values for the majority of the time, necessitating ongoing adjustments to pod request and limit values by DevOps teams or Developers. EMP addresses this by deploying an alternate virtualization layer that monitors actual resource usage of your applications and dynamically allocates compute resources to meet the needs of your application, eliminating the need for manual configuration changes to your pod request and limit values.\n",

      "## Key Differentiators of EMP\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Go beyond bin-packing.** EMP optimizes your Kubernetes utilization by reclaiming existing unused capacity in your cluster. This enables you to go much further beyond just the bin packing benefits, and actually optimize capacity that is allocated to your pods via request and limit values but not actually utilized. \n",
      "2. **Optimize without right-sizing**: Many existing tools try to optimize your Kubernetes resource consumption by modifying your pod's request and limit values. But since EMP can actually tap into existing unused capacity to deploy new workloads, EMP requires making no changes to your pod's request and limit values. \n",
      "3. **Rebalance with zero pod downtime**: When EMP needs to scale and add more capacity, or consolidate to better use existing capacity, it can 'live migrate' workloads around to do this. This means zero pod disruption and much higher availability for your stateful workloads. This is specially important for data services, AI/ML or large java web applications. \n",
      "4. **Continuous Optimization**: EMP automatically monitor and optimize VM deployments behind the scenes to maximize Kubernetes resource utilization.\n",
      "5. **Seamless Scaling**: EMP handle usage spikes by scaling out underlying infrastructure and rebalancing workloads without application downtime.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Key Features of EMP\n",

      "There are several monitoring and visibility tools available on the market that claim to provide significant cost savings for your Kubernetes environment. CloudHealth, Cloudability, and Datadog are great tools for understanding your cloud costs and identifying areas where you can save money. However, they do not specifically focus on automating the changes needed to increase your overall resource utilization.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then there are tools such as open source Karpenter that make use of effective bin packing to allocate nodes just in time that fit your pod's resource requirements. However, these tools can not make a dent at optimizing your Kubernetes utilization if there is resource wastage due to high request and limit values. These tools will also involve a 'consolidation' phase where nodes are interrupted to consolidate fragmented pod deployments. This also requires pod restart which many stateful applications can not tolerate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then there are tools that make it easy to use spot instances with your EKS clusters to reduce your costs. However, spot instances are not a good fit for stateful applications that can not tolerate node interrupts, thus putting a ceiling on the amount of savings such tools can offer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly there are tools that makes adjustments to your application's request and limit values as a way to cut costs. But these tools will also require pod restart for the changes to take effect.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a result, despite the use of these tools, Kubernetes utilization remains low, ranging between 15 and 30%. That means 70% or more of your k8s cloud resources are being completely wasted.\n",
      "\n",
      "With EMP, there is no change to the request and limit values of your application necessary. Your developers will continue to set the requests and limits on the application pods that they desire, and EMP will work behind the scenes to optimize your EKS resource utilization based on demand.\n",
      "\n",
      "EMP is complementary to your existing tools and can provide value on top of these technologies by maximizing utilization behind the scenes.\n",
      "\n",
      "## EMP Benefits For Developers and DevOps\n",
      "\n",
      "Application developers frequently define the resource requirements of their Kubernetes workloads based on peak CPU and memory requirements. However, real-world usage may frequently vary or be significantly lower than configured values for the majority of the time, necessitating ongoing adjustments to pod request and limit values by DevOps teams or Developers. EMP addresses this by deploying an alternate virtualization layer that monitors actual resource usage of your applications and dynamically allocates compute resources to meet the needs of your application, eliminating the need for manual configuration changes to your pod request and limit values.\n",

Below, we outline the key features and mechanisms through which EMP optimizes Kubernetes utilization.\\n\\n<h2>1. Reclaiming Unused Capacity</h2>\\n<p>EMP focuses on identifying and reclaiming existing unused capacity within Kubernetes clusters. This is achieved without requiring any changes to the request and limit values set for application pods. By optimizing the allocation of resources, EMP can significantly reduce costs associated with Kubernetes compute.</p>\\n\\n<h2>2. Live Migration of Workloads</h2>\\n<p>One of the standout features of EMP is its ability to <strong>live migrate</strong> workloads. This means that when scaling is necessary, EMP can move workloads around without causing any disruption to running pods. This feature is particularly beneficial for:</p>\\n<ul>\\n    <li>Stateful workloads</li>\\n    <li>AI/ML applications</li>\\n    <li>Large Java web applications</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Live migration ensures that applications maintain high availability and meet their Service Level Agreements (SLAs) during resource adjustments.</p>\\n\\n<h2>3. Continuous Monitoring & Real-Time Scaling</h2>\\n<p>EMP employs continuous monitoring to identify optimization opportunities in real-time. This includes:</p>\\n<ul>\\n    <li>Proactively scaling resources up or down based on demand</li>\\n    <li>Utilizing live migration techniques to ensure minimal disruption</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>This dynamic approach allows EMP to handle usage spikes effectively, rebalancing workloads without application downtime.</p>\\n\\n<h2>4. Resource Consolidation</h2>\\n<p>EMP utilizes server consolidation techniques to optimize workload placement on the underlying EC2 infrastructure. This significantly reduces wasted CPU and memory resources in EKS clusters, leading to better overall resource utilization.</p>\\n\\n<h2>5. Complementary to Existing Tools</h2>\\n<p>EMP works alongside existing Kubernetes cost management tools, enhancing their effectiveness by maximizing resource utilization. Unlike other tools that may require adjustments to pod configurations, EMP operates behind the scenes, allowing developers to maintain their desired request and limit settings.</p>\\n\\n<h2>6. Simplified Integration Process</h2>\\n<p>The integration of EMP into your AWS EKS environment is straightforward:</p>\\n<ol>\\n    <li>Enable EMP for your AWS account.</li>\\n    <li>Select the desired EKS clusters for optimization.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>This process requires no modifications to applications or cluster management processes, making it accessible for administrators and DevOps teams.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\\n<p>By leveraging features like live migration, continuous monitoring, and resource consolidation, Platform9 Elastic Machine Pool (EMP) effectively optimizes Kubernetes utilization, helping organizations reclaim over 70% of wasted compute resources. This not only reduces costs but also enhances the performance and availability of applications running on AWS EKS.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Further Reading</h2>\\n<p>For a comprehensive understanding of AWS EKS, please refer to the official <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/eks/\">AWS EKS documentation</a>.</p>'}\n",

       "  'result': '<h1>How EMP Optimizes Kubernetes Utilization</h1>\\n\\nPlatform9 Elastic Machine Pool (EMP) is designed to enhance the efficiency of Kubernetes workloads, particularly in AWS EKS environments. Below, we outline the key features and mechanisms through which EMP optimizes Kubernetes utilization.\\n\\n<h2>1. Reclaiming Unused Capacity</h2>\\n<p>EMP focuses on identifying and reclaiming existing unused capacity within Kubernetes clusters. This is achieved without requiring any changes to the request and limit values set for application pods. By optimizing the allocation of resources, EMP can significantly reduce costs associated with Kubernetes compute.</p>\\n\\n<h2>2. Live Migration of Workloads</h2>\\n<p>One of the standout features of EMP is its ability to <strong>live migrate</strong> workloads. This means that when scaling is necessary, EMP can move workloads around without causing any disruption to running pods. This feature is particularly beneficial for:</p>\\n<ul>\\n    <li>Stateful workloads</li>\\n    <li>AI/ML applications</li>\\n    <li>Large Java web applications</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Live migration ensures that applications maintain high availability and meet their Service Level Agreements (SLAs) during resource adjustments.</p>\\n\\n<h2>3. Continuous Monitoring & Real-Time Scaling</h2>\\n<p>EMP employs continuous monitoring to identify optimization opportunities in real-time. This includes:</p>\\n<ul>\\n    <li>Proactively scaling resources up or down based on demand</li>\\n    <li>Utilizing live migration techniques to ensure minimal disruption</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>This dynamic approach allows EMP to handle usage spikes effectively, rebalancing workloads without application downtime.</p>\\n\\n<h2>4. Resource Consolidation</h2>\\n<p>EMP utilizes server consolidation techniques to optimize workload placement on the underlying EC2 infrastructure. This significantly reduces wasted CPU and memory resources in EKS clusters, leading to better overall resource utilization.</p>\\n\\n<h2>5. Complementary to Existing Tools</h2>\\n<p>EMP works alongside existing Kubernetes cost management tools, enhancing their effectiveness by maximizing resource utilization. Unlike other tools that may require adjustments to pod configurations, EMP operates behind the scenes, allowing developers to maintain their desired request and limit settings.</p>\\n\\n<h2>6. Simplified Integration Process</h2>\\n<p>The integration of EMP into your AWS EKS environment is straightforward:</p>\\n<ol>\\n    <li>Enable EMP for your AWS account.</li>\\n    <li>Select the desired EKS clusters for optimization.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>This process requires no modifications to applications or cluster management processes, making it accessible for administrators and DevOps teams.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\\n<p>By leveraging features like live migration, continuous monitoring, and resource consolidation, Platform9 Elastic Machine Pool (EMP) effectively optimizes Kubernetes utilization, helping organizations reclaim over 70% of wasted compute resources. This not only reduces costs but also enhances the performance and availability of applications running on AWS EKS.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Further Reading</h2>\\n<p>For a comprehensive understanding of AWS EKS, please refer to the official <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/eks/\">AWS EKS documentation</a>.</p>'},\n",

Think of EVM Pool as an EKS Node Pool.  \\nAn EVM Pool represents a collection of EVMs. Each EKS cluster imported into an EMP instance will have one or more EVM Pools. EVM Pools are not shared across different EKS clusters. This ensures that each EKS cluster has its own dedicated resources for running workloads.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'Markdown Header 2': 'EVM Pool Specification'}, page_content='## EVM Pool Specification  \\nEVM Pool specification serves as a template for easy configuration of EVM Pool settings that can then be used to create EVMs for one or multiple EKS clusters.  \\nFor instance, if majority of your workloads are run on an `m5.4xlarge`  instance type, you can create a specification for this option and then map multiple EKS clusters to this specification. Behind the scenes, this will result in the creation of a new EVM Pool for each of the specified EKS clusters with this configuration.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'Markdown Header 2': 'Configuration Options for EVM Pool Creation'}, page_content='## Configuration Options for EVM Pool Creation  \\nFollowing are the configuration options when creating an EVM Pool.  \\n### Instance Type  \\nEMP models the supported EVM instance types after the AWS supported instance families and types.  EMP today supports majority of the instance types and families supported by AWS.  \\nThe EVM instance type you can choose for your EVM pool has a direct correlation to the AWS bare metal instance type you have chosen as part of the bare metal pool configuration. The list of instance types available to choose during the creation of an EVM pool is filtered based on the bare metal instance type creation in the previous step of the wizard. For example, if you choose m5.metal as your bare metal instance type, then the EVM instance types you can choose for EVM pool creation are filtered to only those that are part of the same AWS family of instances.  \\n### SSH Key  \\nYou specify the public SSH key that will be injected into each new EVM instance. You can use this SSH key to access your EVM instances in the future, ensuring that only authorized personnel from your team can log into the EVMs.  \\n### System Root Disk Size  \\nThis allows you to define the size of the system root disk for each EVM instance. The system root disk is where the operating system and essential system files and directories are installed. Specifying the right root disk size is important as it determines the storage capacity available for the operating system and system-related files.  \\n### Operating System  \\nCurrently only Ubuntu 22.04 is supported as the operating system for EVM instances.  \\n### Minimum EVMs  \\nSpecify the minimum number of EVMs that may be deployed within this EVM Pool. This setting provides guidance to the EVM autoscaler, which uses this parameter to make decisions regarding EVM Pool scaling. Setting a minimum number of EVMs ensures that there is a baseline level of resources available at all times, preventing resource shortages during workload spikes or unexpected demands.  \\n### CPU and Memory Over-commitment  \\nCPU and Memory over-commitment ratios determine how many EVMs are deployed on each bare metal node. These ratios influence the level of resource over-commitment within the EVM Pool. Adjusting these over-commitment ratios allows you to fine-tune the allocation of CPU and memory resources to optimize performance and resource utilization. Higher ratios may lead to denser deployments but may create higher resource contention and performance issues.  \\n#### Overcommitment Ratio Example  \\nLets say that you selected m5.metal as your bare metal instance type. Each m5.metal instance consists of 384 GB of memory. Lets now say that you set the memory over-commitment ratio for your EVM pool to 1.5. This would mean that on a single instance of m5.metal, EMP can provision 9 instances of m5.4xlarge (64 GB memory each), vs without the over-provisioning ratio, only 6 instances of m5.4xlarge could be provisioned on a single m5.metal instance.')]"

       "'<h1>Configuring Bare Metal Pools (BMPs) in EMP</h1><p>To configure Bare Metal Pools (BMPs) in Elastic Machine Pools (EMP), it\\'s essential to understand the key concepts involved in the process. Below is a structured guide to help you through the configuration.</p><h2>Key Concepts</h2><ul><li><strong>Bare Metal Pools (BMPs):</strong> These are pools of EC2 bare metal instances that provide high performance and low latency for workloads. They are particularly useful for applications that require direct access to hardware.</li><li><strong>EMP Architecture:</strong> EMP integrates seamlessly with your AWS EKS environment, allowing you to deploy workloads to Elastic Virtual Machines (EVMs) and BMPs. The architecture includes components like the EMP Service, Admission Controller, and Rebalancer, which work together to optimize resource utilization.</li><li><strong>EMP Cost Analyzer:</strong> This optional component helps you analyze potential cost savings when using EMP by collecting metrics from your EKS cluster. It can provide insights into resource utilization and cost efficiency.</li><li><strong>Seamless Integration:</strong> EMP requires no changes to your existing EKS clusters or applications. It operates in the background, optimizing resource allocation without disrupting your workloads.</li></ul><h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2><ol><li><strong>Log into the EMP UI:</strong> Access the EMP user interface with your credentials.</li><li><strong>Create an EMP Instance:</strong> Follow the \"Create EMP\" wizard. Select your cloud credentials and the AWS region where your EKS cluster resides.</li><li><strong>Select EKS Cluster:</strong> Choose the EKS cluster you wish to optimize from the list provided.</li><li><strong>Configure Security Groups:</strong> Set up security group configurations to enable communication between the EKS control plane and the EMP worker nodes (EVMs), as well as between EVMs and non-EVM nodes. Ensure to add the tag <code>kubernetes.io/cluster/<cluster_name>: shared</code> to the bare metal security group for automatic registration and discovery of target groups.</li><li><strong>Select EC2 Instance Type:</strong> Choose an AWS EC2 bare metal instance type that matches the instance family of your current EKS worker nodes (e.g., if using r5.8xlarge, select r5.metal).</li><li><strong>VPC Configuration:</strong> Select an existing VPC that your EKS cluster is part of.</li><li><strong>Create EVM Pool:</strong> Create an EVM pool for your EKS cluster using the same EC2 instance type as your current EKS worker nodes.</li><li><strong>Finalize Creation:</strong> Complete the EMP instance creation process. This may take up to 30 minutes. Monitor the status from the \\'Overview\\' screen in the EMP UI.</li></ol><h2>Gotchas and Caveats</h2><ul><li>Ensure that the selected EC2 instance type for the BMP is compatible with your existing EKS worker nodes to avoid performance issues.</li><li>Double-check the security group settings to ensure proper communication between nodes; misconfigurations can lead to connectivity issues.</li><li>Be aware that the creation process may take time, so plan accordingly to avoid disruptions in your workflow.</li><li>If you choose to deploy the EMP Cost Analyzer, ensure that the necessary components (Prometheus, Node Exporter, Kube State Metrics) are correctly set up to gather metrics for cost analysis.</li></ul><p>By following these steps, you should be able to configure Bare Metal Pools in EMP effectively. If you encounter any issues or have further questions, feel free to ask!</p>'"

Learn more about [why io2 volumes with EMP](/emp/io2-migration-guide-for-emp).  \\nThe next step is to ensure that your EBS CSI driver creates io2 volumes by default using StorageClass. Additionally, use the provided PVC template to enable multi-attach functionality for the io2 volumes.  \\n### StorageClass Config  \\nThis StorageClass template will ensure the EBS CSI driver creates io2 volumes.  \\n$plugin[{\\n\"type\": \"code-block\",\\n\"data\": {\\n\"languageBlocks\": [\\n{\\n\"code\": \"apiVersion: storage.k8s.io\\\\/v1\\\\nkind: StorageClass\\\\nmetadata:\\\\n  name: <STORAGE CLASS NAME>\\\\nprovisioner: ebs.csi.aws.com\\\\nparameters:\\\\n  type: io2\\\\n  iops: \\\\\"<REQUIRED IOPS>\\\\\"\",\\n\"language\": \"none\"\\n}\\n]\\n}\\n}]$  \\n**Notes:**  \\n- You must set `parameters.type`  to `io2`  to ensure the creation of `io2` volumes.\\n- You must specify `parameters.iops`.\\n- You can set additional parameters as needed.  \\n### PVC Config  \\nThis PVC template will enable multi-attach functionality for the io2 volumes.  \\n$plugin[{\\n\"type\": \"code-block\",\\n\"data\": {\\n\"languageBlocks\": [\\n{\\n\"code\": \"apiVersion: v1\\\\nkind: PersistentVolumeClaim\\\\nmetadata:\\\\n  name: <PVC NAME>\\\\nspec:\\\\n  accessModes:\\\\n    - ReadWriteMany\\\\n  volumeMode: Block\\\\n  storageClassName: <STORAGE CLASS NAME>\\\\n  resources:\\\\n    requests:\\\\n      storage: <SIZE>\",\\n\"language\": \"none\"\\n}\\n]\\n}\\n}]$  \\n**Notes:**  \\n- `spec.accessModes` must be set to `ReadWriteMany` to enable multi-attach functionality for the io2 volumes.  \\nThe EBS CSI driver will continue to work as expected for non-EVM worker nodes in your EKS cluster.

For eg, if you use r5.8xlarge instances for EC2 workers, choose r5.metal instance  Read [auto$](/emp/bare-metal-pool-configuration) for options to configure.\\n- For VPC configuration, select an existing VPC that your EKS cluster is part of. Read [auto$](/emp/bare-metal-pool-vpc-config) for an in depth understanding of the options available here.\\n- **Create EVM Pool**: An EVM pool is like a node group.

Your actual spend on bare metal instances for that month. This is your 'After Cost'  \\nThe difference between 1 and 2 is your savings with EMP. We then charge you a % of the savings, assuming the savings were greater than zero.  \\nSo for eg, say in the current month, you had 5 EVMs running of size m5.4xlarge for the entire month, and based on your current savings plan based rate it would have costed you $100 to run those EVMs. Then that would be your 'Before Cost'. Say with EMP we ran these EVMs on 1 m5.metal bare metal instance, and the cost of running that instance for that month was $50. This is your 'After Cost'. The difference is $50 which accounts for 50% savings. And we will charge you a certain pre-defined % off $50 to you for that month - in an invoice.  \\n### How is EMP billed?  \\nEMP is billed via a monthly invoice sent to you at the end of each month.  \\n### How do you work with my existing Savings Plan, EDP, other discounts?  \\nYes. In most cases, your existing savings plans, EDP or other commitment based discounts should apply to any bare metal instances deployed with EMP. [Contact us](/emp/Support) with your specific pricing commitment details and we'd be happy to assist.\"),\n",

How can I assist you today with EMP (Elastic Machine Pools)? If you have any questions or need help navigating or troubleshooting, feel free to ask!\\nHuman: What is EMP?\\nAI: <h1>What is EMP?</h1>\\n<p>Platform9 Elastic Machine Pool (EMP) is a <strong>Kubernetes cost optimization platform</strong> designed for public cloud native Kubernetes offerings. EMP aims to help organizations reclaim over 70% of wasted Kubernetes compute resources that might be sitting idle, which can significantly reduce overall Kubernetes cluster costs.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Key Features of EMP</h2>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Support for AWS EKS:</strong> Currently, EMP supports the AWS EKS Kubernetes service, with plans to include GKE and AKS in the future.</li>\\n<li><strong>Performance and Flexibility:</strong> EMP uses Elastic Virtual Machines (EVMs) that combine the performance of bare metal servers with the flexibility of virtualization.</li>\\n<li><strong>Zero-touch Lifecycle Management:</strong> EMP automates the lifecycle management of EVMs, including provisioning, scaling, monitoring, and maintenance, allowing teams to focus on their applications.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<h2>Cost Savings</h2>\\n<p>By utilizing EMP, organizations can expect substantial savings on their Kubernetes infrastructure costs. The platform calculates savings based on a comparison of the projected costs of running EVMs versus actual spending on bare metal instances.</p>\\n\\n<p>In summary, EMP is a powerful tool for optimizing Kubernetes costs, enhancing performance, and simplifying management. If you have more specific questions or need guidance on using EMP, please let me know!</p>\\nHuman: how to configure BMPs in EMP?\\nAI: <h1>Configuring Bare Metal Pools (BMPs) in EMP</h1>\\n<p>To configure Bare Metal Pools (BMPs) in Platform9 Elastic Machine Pools (EMP), follow the steps outlined below. This process will help you set up your environment to optimize Kubernetes workloads effectively.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>\\n<ol>\\n<li><strong>Log into the EMP UI:</strong> Start by logging into your EMP user interface.</li>\\n<li><strong>Create EMP Instance:</strong> Follow the \"Create EMP\" wizard to initiate the configuration.</li>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Select your cloud credentials that you\\'ve previously set up.</li>\\n<li>Choose the AWS region where your EKS cluster resides.</li>\\n<li>Select the EKS cluster you want to optimize from the list.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<li><strong>Configure Security Groups:</strong> Select the security group configuration options to enable communication between the EKS control plane and the EMP-created worker nodes (EVMs).</li>\\n<li><strong>Select EC2 Instance Type:</strong> Choose an AWS EC2 bare metal instance type to create a new BMP. This instance type should be from the same instance family as the EC2 instances you use for your EKS cluster.</li>\\n<li><strong>VPC Configuration:</strong> Select an existing VPC that your EKS cluster is part of for the BMP.</li>\\n<li><strong>Create EVM Pool:</strong> Create one EVM pool for your EKS cluster, selecting the same EC2 instance type you currently use.</li>\\n<li><strong>Finalize Configuration:</strong> Complete the wizard to create the EMP instance. The creation process may take up to 30 minutes.</li>\\n</ol>\\n\\n<h2>Monitoring and Verification</h2>\\n<p>After the instance is created, you can monitor its status from the \\'Overview\\' screen in the EMP UI. Once ready, you should see the EVM worker nodes in your AWS EKS dashboard along with your regular EC2 worker nodes.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Gotchas or Caveats</h2>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Ensure that your AWS credentials have the necessary permissions for creating and managing resources in your chosen region.</li>\\n<li>Double-check the compatibility of the EC2 instance types to avoid operational issues.</li>\\n<li>Be aware that the BMP creation process may take some time, and monitor the status closely to avoid confusion.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>If you have any further questions or need clarification on specific steps, feel free to ask!</p>\\nHuman: System: \\nRole:\\nYou are an expert support assistant for EMP (Elastic Machine Pools), helping users—ranging from first-time users to experienced     system admins and DevOps personnel navigate, understand, and troubleshoot the product.\\n\\nTask:\\nProvide accurate, concise and structured(rules given below in point no:7) responses to the queries of the users based on the below rules.

How can I assist you today with EMP (Elastic Machine Pools)? If you have any questions or need help navigating or troubleshooting, feel free to ask!\\nHuman: What is EMP?\\nAI: <h1>What is EMP?</h1>\\n<p>Platform9 Elastic Machine Pool (EMP) is a <strong>Kubernetes cost optimization platform</strong> designed for public cloud native Kubernetes offerings. EMP aims to help organizations reclaim over 70% of wasted Kubernetes compute resources that might be sitting idle, which can significantly reduce overall Kubernetes cluster costs.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Key Features of EMP</h2>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Support for AWS EKS:</strong> Currently, EMP supports the AWS EKS Kubernetes service, with plans to include GKE and AKS in the future.</li>\\n<li><strong>Performance and Flexibility:</strong> EMP uses Elastic Virtual Machines (EVMs) that combine the performance of bare metal servers with the flexibility of virtualization.</li>\\n<li><strong>Zero-touch Lifecycle Management:</strong> EMP automates the lifecycle management of EVMs, including provisioning, scaling, monitoring, and maintenance, allowing teams to focus on their applications.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<h2>Cost Savings</h2>\\n<p>By utilizing EMP, organizations can expect substantial savings on their Kubernetes infrastructure costs. The platform calculates savings based on a comparison of the projected costs of running EVMs versus actual spending on bare metal instances.</p>\\n\\n<p>In summary, EMP is a powerful tool for optimizing Kubernetes costs, enhancing performance, and simplifying management. If you have more specific questions or need guidance on using EMP, please let me know!</p>\\nHuman: how to configure BMPs in EMP?'),\n",
       " AIMessage(content='<h1>Configuring Bare Metal Pools (BMPs) in EMP</h1>\\n<p>To configure Bare Metal Pools (BMPs) in Platform9 Elastic Machine Pools (EMP), follow the steps outlined below. This process will help you set up your environment to optimize Kubernetes workloads effectively.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>\\n<ol>\\n<li><strong>Log into the EMP UI:</strong> Start by logging into your EMP user interface.</li>\\n<li><strong>Create EMP Instance:</strong> Follow the \"Create EMP\" wizard to initiate the configuration.</li>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Select your cloud credentials that you\\'ve previously set up.</li>\\n<li>Choose the AWS region where your EKS cluster resides.</li>\\n<li>Select the EKS cluster you want to optimize from the list.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<li><strong>Configure Security Groups:</strong> Select the security group configuration options to enable communication between the EKS control plane and the EMP-created worker nodes (EVMs).</li>\\n<li><strong>Select EC2 Instance Type:</strong> Choose an AWS EC2 bare metal instance type to create a new BMP. This instance type should be from the same instance family as the EC2 instances you use for your EKS cluster.</li>\\n<li><strong>VPC Configuration:</strong> Select an existing VPC that your EKS cluster is part of for the BMP.</li>\\n<li><strong>Create EVM Pool:</strong> Create one EVM pool for your EKS cluster, selecting the same EC2 instance type you currently use.</li>\\n<li><strong>Finalize Configuration:</strong> Complete the wizard to create the EMP instance. The creation process may take up to 30 minutes.</li>\\n</ol>\\n\\n<h2>Monitoring and Verification</h2>\\n<p>After the instance is created, you can monitor its status from the \\'Overview\\' screen in the EMP UI. Once ready, you should see the EVM worker nodes in your AWS EKS dashboard along with your regular EC2 worker nodes.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Gotchas or Caveats</h2>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Ensure that your AWS credentials have the necessary permissions for creating and managing resources in your chosen region.</li>\\n<li>Double-check the compatibility of the EC2 instance types to avoid operational issues.</li>\\n<li>Be aware that the BMP creation process may take some time, and monitor the status closely to avoid confusion.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>If you have any further questions or need clarification on specific steps, feel free to ask!</p>')]"
